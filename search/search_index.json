Is it possible to close off a well-known source of risk, while still ensuring basic functionality?</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"blog/eks-hardening-blocking-pod-level-access-to-imds/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>The principle of role-based access control (RBAC) within kubernetes is built on a simple idea - provide only the permissions required by an individual process (pod, in this case) in order for it to do its job. There's a lot riding on this control: get it right, and pods managing all kinds of different workloads can safely operate alongside each other in a common environment; get it wrong though, and there is the very real risk of simple vulnerabilities escalating into potentially disastrous outcomes.</p> <p>The situation isn't helped by the fact that, within a kubernetes cluster, not all players are equal. Pods may only need basic permissions to perform their specific task (pulling messages from SQS, writing files to S3 etc.) but something has to provide the resources for those pods to run on, which is the role of the worker nodes. These nodes require access at a more fundamental (and impactful) level - they need to be able to pull the images that run the workloads, as well as understand the resources and configuration of the environment they exist within.</p> <p>A lot of this functionality is handled via the Internal Metadata Service (IMDS), a locally-accessible API that provides access to configuration data, as well as the credentials needed for the node to authenticate itself. IMDS was never intended to service anything but the hosting node, but the nature of the container runtime (EKS uses containerd) means that pods are simply processes running atop the worker, allowing them to access the infamous <code>http://169.254.169.254</code> address just as easily. Since the first version of IMDS (<code>IMDSv1</code>) was built with no method of authentication, this enabled a straightforward path to privilege escalation that resulted in a number of high-profile incidents, such as the Capital One data breach in 2019.</p> <p>In response, Amazon introduced IMDSv2 and took a major step forward in reducing this risk, by mandating use of the metadata API must first involve generation of a session token via an <code>HTTP PUT</code> request. This token must then be supplied via a header in all subsequent requests. Asssuming that IMDSv2 is not just enabled but actually enforced, this prevents an attacker from proxying metadata requests using various common methods, such as abusing a misconfigured firewall, unrestricted reverse proxy or server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability. And yet, it still doesn't fully address the problem.</p>"},{"location":"blog/eks-hardening-blocking-pod-level-access-to-imds/#the-remaining-threat-rce","title":"The Remaining Threat: RCE","text":"<p>By itself, the new approach to security in IMDSv2 is still vulnerable to abuse through the discovery of remote code execution (RCE).

But the risk of them being stolen from application pods running on the nodes represents a serious threat. All that it takes is for a public-facing app to be shipped with an RCE vulnerability - either through inclusion of insecure code, or the use of a vulnerable dependency - and a large part of the EKS cluster's cloud environment is exposed, even if IMDSv2 is enforced.</p>"},{"location":"blog/eks-hardening-blocking-pod-level-access-to-imds/#the-solution-imds-hop-limit","title":"The Solution: IMDS Hop Limit?","text":"<p>There is usually more to the story, however, and in this case it comes in the form of the IMDS response hop limit. The AWS documentation outlines the purpose of this setting:</p> <p>The hop limit is the number of network hops that the PUT response is allowed to make. You can set the hop limit to a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 64.</p> <p>Essentially operating as a packet-level time to live (TTL), the hop limit dictates how far across the network a token (PUT) response can travel. Setting it to the minimum value of <code>1</code> means it can only reach the calling node itself, which again is absolutely required for normal cluster operation. A value of <code>2</code> allows the response to travel up to two hops, meaning it could reach the pods running on a node - exactly where it might be attainable via RCE.</p> <p>Based on this information then, it sounds like the obvious choice would be to simply set the hop limit of all nodes to <code>1</code>. The docs, however, also include a vague note of caution on this:</p> <p>In a container environment, a hop limit of 1 can cause issues.</p> <p>In other words, under certain security configurations, pods may need to be able to call IMDS on their host nodes in order to perform their intended function. This could be for the purposes of obtaining credentials, or even something as seemingly harmless as identifying the region the node exists in. So while setting the IMDS hop limit to <code>1</code> might seem like a good way to improve security, it might also prevent pods from running at all, which is definitely not ideal. To further complicate matters, it seems that when a hop limit is not explicitly specified (via a launch template or similar) AWS will often set a default hop limit of <code>2</code>, leading many to believe that this is infact the required value for their EKS cluster to function correctly.</p> <p>Clearly, there is some confusion around what is really possible with this setting. The only real way to understand the situation is to try out some different configurations, and evaluate the results.</p>"},{"location":"blog/eks-hardening-blocking-pod-level-access-to-imds/#the-challenge","title":"The Challenge","text":"<p>So the question becomes - can we mandate a metadata response hop limit of <code>1</code>, thereby preventing the threat of privilege escalation from a compromised pod, while still allowing pods to operate correctly?</p> <p>Pod-level security mechanisms have evolved a lot over the years, to the point where there are a number of choices when it comes to management.
